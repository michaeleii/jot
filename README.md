# Jot

Jot is a simple social media app that allows users to post their thoughts and ideas quickly. I created this app to learn more about the newest features of Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS and AWS S3.

## What I learned from this project

- How to use React Server Components to fetch data on the server
- How to use Next.js Server Actions to mutate data on the server
- How to implement Partial Pre-rendering with Next.js
- How to use NextAuth to implement user authentication
- How to implement Google OAuth to allow users to sign in with their Google account
- How to use Turso (a SQLite edge-based relational database) to store user data
- How to use an Drizzle ORM to query the database
- How to use Tailwind CSS to style the app
- How to use AWS S3 to store images securely on the frontend
